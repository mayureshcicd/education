package edu.java.basic;
class CarClass{
   String carName;
   double carSpeed;
   int carId;
   CarClass(String name, double speed, int Id)
   {
	this.carName=name;
	this.carSpeed=speed;
	this.carId=Id;
   }
}
class Driver{
   String driverName;
   int driverAge;
   Driver(String name, int age){
      this.driverName=name;
      this.driverAge=age;
   }
}
class TransportCompany{
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
	CarClass obj= new CarClass("Ford", 180.15, 9988);
	Driver obj2 = new Driver("Andy", 45);
	System.out.println(obj2.driverName+" is a driver of car Id: "+obj.carId);
   }
}  
<span class="success">Output: Andy is a driver of car Id: 9988</span>
