<h3>Static members</h3>
<ul>

 <li>We can use or acces all static members, methods of class without creating the object.</li>
 <li>All static members , methods will shared to all created instances means all created object of class.</li>
 <li>We can not call non static methods from static method.</li>
 <li>Static methods can not refer using this or super keyword.</li>
 </ul>
<div class="nolinkBHEAD">static Keyword In Java</div>

<p>The static keyword in java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply java static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested class. The static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the class. Final can be:</p>
<p> The static can be:
<ol>
    <li>variable (also known as class variable)</li>
    <li> method (also known as class method)</li>
    <li>block</li>
	<li>nested class</li>
</ol>
</p>
<div class="nolinkBHEAD">Java static variable</div>

<p>If you declare any variable as static, it is known static variable.</p>
<ol>
	<li>The static variable can be used to create common properties in class, and we can acces it without creating a class object</li>    
    <li>The static variable gets memory only once in class area at the time of class loading.</li>
</ol>


<div class="nolinkBHEAD">Java static method</div>

<p>If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.</p>
<ol>
	<li>A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.</li>
    <li>A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.</li>
    <li>static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.</li>
</ol>
<div class="nolinkBHEAD">Restrictions for static method</div>

<p>There are two main restrictions for the static method. They are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
    <li>this and super cannot be used in static context.</li>
</ol>
<div class="nolinkBHEAD">Java static block</div>

<ol>
	<li>Is used to initialize the static data member.</li>
    It is executed before main method at the time of classloading.</li>

<h1>features of static keyword </h1>
<p>
1.	The static is a keyword in java.<br>
2.	Static variable, method, class are stored in perm gen(permanent generation memory).<br>

<h3>Static variable</h3>
<ul>
<li>static variables are also known as class variables.</li>
<li>We need not to create instance of class for accessing static variables.</li>
<li>static variables will remain same for different instance/objects of class but for every new object instance variables will be initialized to new value.</li>
<li>Static variables can be used inside constructor.</li>
<li>Static variables are not serialized in java</li>
<li>Its important to know that only the variables and their values (primitives or references) are stored in PermGen space.</li>
<li>If static variable is a reference to an object that which is stored in the normal sections of the heap (string pool, young/old generation or survivor space). <br>
Those objects are not stored in PermGen space.</li>
<li>Using instance.staticVariable is bad practice, We must use ClassName.staticVariableName</li>
</ul>

<h3>Static method</h3>
