<div class="nolinkBHEAD">What is Aggregation in java</div>
 <p>Aggregation is also a relationship between two classes like association. its a directional association, which means it is strictly a one way association. 
 <b>It represents a Has-A relationship.</b></p>
  
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
Example : 
For example consider two classes Student class and Address class. 
each student must have an address so the relationship between student and address is a Has-A relationship. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
package edu.java.basic;
 
class Address
{
   int streetNum;
   String city;
   String state;
   String country;
   Address(int street, String c, String st, String coun)
   {
       this.streetNum=street;
       this.city =c;
       this.state = st;
       this.country = coun;
   }
}
class StudentClass
{
   int rollNum;
   String studentName;
  //Student Has-A Address (Has-a relationship between student and address)
   Address studentAddr; //Aggergation of Address class , It represents a Has-A relationship
   
   StudentClass(int roll, String name, Address addr){
       this.rollNum=roll;
       this.studentName=name;
       this.studentAddr = addr;
   }
}
public class AggregationDemo {
   public static void main(String args[]){
       Address ad = new Address(55, "Agra", "UP", "India");
       StudentClass obj = new StudentClass(123, "Chaitanya", ad);
       System.out.println(obj.rollNum);
       System.out.println(obj.studentName);
       System.out.println(obj.studentAddr.streetNum);
       System.out.println(obj.studentAddr.city);
       System.out.println(obj.studentAddr.state);
       System.out.println(obj.studentAddr.country);
   }

<div class="nolinkBHEAD">Why we need Aggregation?</div>
<p> <b>To maintain code re-usability.</b>We use Aggergation.<br>
Example : -
<ol>
<li>Suppose there are two other classes <b>College</b> <b>and Staff</b></li>
<li>We can use the reference of Address class as Address of <b>College</b> <b>and Staff</b> classes.</li>
<li>Hence we can improve code re-usability by using Aggregation relationship.</li>
</ol>
<b>
Student Has-A Address (Has-a relationship between student and address)<br>
College Has-A Address (Has-a relationship between college and address)<br>
Staff Has-A Address (Has-a relationship between staff and address)<br>
</b>
